- name: Deep Learning Proxy of Reservoir Simulation
  description: propose to employ deep learning (DL) methods to create an efficient proxy of the 3D fluid flow simulator. The objective is to train a DL model that will take 3D cells of permeability and porosity values as an input and then produce 3D images of saturation and pressure as a function of time with given discretization.

- name: Reinforcement Learning on Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkik
  description: Our goal is to build a turret game where the player can shoot enemy units while allowing friendly units to enter. We will train a reinforcement learning agent to play as the turret, where its goal is to allow ten friendly units to enter the base, and loses if an enemy unit has entered the base or if two friendly units were shot.
