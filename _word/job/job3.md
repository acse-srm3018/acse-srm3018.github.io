Satan wants Job to curse God, this time he cursed the day of his birth (v3-10), and he would rather have not lived (v11-19). Birth and death. The pain and misery he faced caused him to say/write all these, and he did not blame God.

Job wonder why he is in such a situation (v20). Interestingly, Job still feared God and have faith in God, he is not concerned about what he has lost, and his health; Job is more concerned about losing God. Job is concerned about him or his children sinning against God (Job 1:5), that is what he greatly feared (v25).

Despite Job situation, he did not sin against God, he wondered why he is in such a situation. I believe God is listening to him.
