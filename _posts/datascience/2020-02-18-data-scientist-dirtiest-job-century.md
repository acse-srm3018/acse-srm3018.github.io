According to the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/), Data scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century.

For me, having that "data scientist" job title for the past five years, I still haven't figured out which part of me is sexy. Except maybe my new permed hair that makes me look like a Korean Oppa.

It's true that with the emergence of cloud and businesses moving to the Internet, it has led to an explosion of data. Thus this has driven the demand for data scientists.

But what does a data scientists job entail on a day-to-day basis?

We can find our answer to this question from job postings. Let me sum up for you the popular ones.

- A/B tests to validate models
- build predictive models, build machine learning pipelines and apply artificial intelligence
- conceptualise analyses to business stakeholders
- develop algorithms to understand business and customers, to make better business decisions
- experiment/research new technologies and methods to improve technical capabilities

_These sounds sexy, isn't it?_

Unless you are working Kaggle dataset, these job descriptions are just a small part of being a data scientist.

The following [survey results by CrowdFlower](https://visit.figure-eight.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf) sum up a typical day for a data scientist.

The majority of the time spent is on collecting datasets, cleaning and organising data.
