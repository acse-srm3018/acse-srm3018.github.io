Machine learning has been amongst the hottest topics around for several years, with research spending focused on machine learning [growing sharply](https://pureai.com/articles/2019/07/23/nwsdes-machine-learning-market-growth.aspx): from about $1.58 billion in 2017 to a projected $20.83 billion in 2024.

On the academic scene, approximately 100 new scientific machine learning papers are [published every day on Arxiv](http://data-mining.philippe-fournier-viger.com/too-many-machine-learning-papers/), averaging one article every 15 minutes.

This shows the level of excitement and progress in machine learning. If you are like me, how are you going to keep up with advances in this field?

In this article, I will share 7 YouTube channels that share the same excitement as you (and I) do. These channels aim to uncover the latest and coolest development in machine learning.

Let's begin.

# 1. Two MinuteÂ Papers

First on the list, I personally highly recommend Two Minute Papers. It introduces the latest AI-related research in a way that is engaging and fun.

> Awesome research for everyone. Two new science videos every week. You'll loveÂ it!

Whether you are looking for reinforcement learning, robotics, DeepFake detector, development on AlphaStar or natural language processing; you name it, they have it.

The list of selected research on this channel is definitely one that is interesting. The content delivery and demonstrations are so clear and concise. It is an absolute pleasure to watch every time.

Since this is my favourite channel, let me show you one of the videos, [OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek and Breaks The Game! ðŸ¤–](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M) I am sure you will enjoy it.

# 2. LexÂ Fridman

Lex Fridman conducts interviews with experts on artificial intelligence, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles.

> Videos exploring research topics in artificial intelligence, deep learning, autonomous vehicles, andÂ beyond.

My favourite part of this channel is the AI podcast that features interviews with experts working on AI. In the interviews, they discuss opinions on recent AI advances. This channel will keep you updated on the latest developments, ideas and concerns revolve around AI.

Lex Fridman is a research scientist at MIT; he conducts and uploads deep learning lectures and autonomous vehicle lectures at MIT.

# 3. Kaggle

Kaggle, Your Home for Data Science. In data science, Kaggle is no stranger. It is a platform for users to find datasets, explore and learn from one another, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

> Kaggle is the world's largest community of data scientists. Join us to compete, collaborate, learn, and do your data scienceÂ work.

![channel](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*vriRz7nZJmF5FE0q-t-d2w.png)

The lesser-known is their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSNeZleDn9c74yQc-EKnVTA), and it is as amazing as the main website. They included tutorials on all aspects of data science, stories on winning competitions, and live coding sessions to solve data science problems. There are so much to learn from this channel.

There is also a playlist called the [Kaggle Reading Group](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu8t5ycqvp7I07jTjol3RCl9) where someone will read and discuss research papers weekly. Wow!

# 4. ArXivÂ Insights

ArXiv Insights aims to simplify and explain technical components in machine learning scientific papers.

> My name is Xander Steenbrugge, and I read a ton of papers on Machine Learning and AI. But papers can be a bit dry & take a while to read.Â â€¦ In this channel, I try to summarize my core take-aways from a technical point of view while making them accessible for a bigger audience.

![channel](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Nq1rXhht8pzboeyLVzgslQ.png)

At the time of writing, this channel has only 11 videos, but its high quality and reliable content have attracted 45K subscribers. Xander Steenbrugge videos are so engaging; he breakdown complicated topics like generative adversarial networks into step by step bite-size explanations.

# 5. YannicÂ Kilcher

Yannic Kilcher focuses on explaining deep learning research papers by thoroughly reading through the paper and supporting documents. He explains concepts in these papers with notes and drawings. He covers topics on deep learning architectures, natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

![channel](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*O0sfT6eXgp8pkZUTcKYdsA.png)

What I like about his videos is his picks on novelty papers. He explains with such high level of details that he uncovers each idea paragraph by paragraph. He will reference additional resources to reveal any concepts outside of the paper. At the end of it, it feels like I have a full understanding of the paper as if I have read thoroughly for at least three times.

# 6. Leo Isikdogan

Leo Isikdogan creates educational how-tos videos on machine learning, computer vision and image & video processing.

> â€¦ concise videos that intuitively explain the hot topics in computer science, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and image and video processing.

![channel](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*NCm6jI03xzNBke6ikQbgng.png)

Leo Isikdogan updates us on interesting projects and use-cases from on how machine learning can be applied in our projects through his how-tos videos.
This channel is also great for anyone starting on deep learning, so much to learn from with the deep learning crash course series and hands-on with TensorFlow coding sessions.
