# How neuroscience inspires AI

Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence. It has been an inspiration for building human-like artificial intelligence.

## #1. Design AI systems that emulate human intelligence

Recent artificial intelligence advancements are taking the media by storm. They can perform impressive feats such as:

-   [object recognition](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-waymo-cruise-uber) that [enables self-driving cars](http://news.mit.edu/2019/human-reasoning-ai-driverless-car-navigation-0523)
-   [playing video games](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18196135/google-deepmind-ai-starcraft-2-victory) that [outperform world best players](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03298-6)
-   [detecting breast cancer](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045635/google-ai-detect-breast-cancer-mammograms-healthcare) [faster and more accurate than doctors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6)

These machines can perform tasks and solve problems better than us, but they are only designed to excel in the intended functions. However impressive these may seem to be, we are still decades away from building artificial human intelligence.

Building machines that have truly human-like learning and cognitive that can learn and think as we do has been an ongoing pursuit. What does it mean for a [machine to learn or think like a person](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00289.pdf)?

-   able to explain and understand problems
-   learning-to-learn to acquire knowledge
-   generalise knowledge to new tasks and situations

Our understanding of our brain has allowed us to design models which emulating the brain. In a [study by KAIST](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200130104921.htm), they developed a computational and neural mechanism for human meta reinforcement learning.

As humans, we can adapt to complexity and uncertainty when learning and making decisions. They aim to build models that can make decisions like humans and solves problems in the same way that humans do.

Their discoveries have opened up the possibility that might lead to machines that can take on more human-like intelligence.

## #2. Build neural networks that mimic brain structure

We borrow inspirations from the structure of a human brain and designed the neural networks we know today. The idea of neurons in neural networks has similar characteristics to our biological neurons in our brain.

A human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, each individually linked to other neurons. Biological neurons are cells, when it gets activated, it generates a spike and sends information to other neurons.

Like our brain, a neural network consists of many interconnected neurons. When a neuron receives inputs from other neurons, it gets activated, and it sends information to other neurons.

An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron)]

The brain’s plasticity allows us to learn and improve our skills. Every time we learn new things, we are creating and strengthening the connections between neurons. That’s why when we practise a task, we become better at it.

Neural networks learn when we feed it with lots of data. Each connection of our neural network is associated with a weight that dictates the importance between neurons. During the training process, the weights are tuned accordingly to strengthen or weaken the connection.

# How AI advances neuroscience

Artificial intelligence is rapidly progressing as an invaluable tool in neuroscience.

## #1. Understand how our brain works

Neuroscientists are interested to understand how our brain works. How it processes our thoughts and our senses, how it controls and moves our bodies.

The advancement of artificial intelligence systems can help drive neuroscience forward and unlock the secrets of the brain. It allows neuroscientists and researchers to build better models of our brain.

Neural networks are acting as “virtual brains” that capture an underlying representation of our brain. It can produce patterns of neural activities that resemble the pattern recorded from the brain. These allow us to test hypotheses and observe the results from simulations, before testing and collecting data from animals and humans.

How artificial intelligence systems does its computation is vastly different from our brain. Neural networks are only a rough analogy of how the brain works; it models synapses as numbers in a high dimensional matrix. But in reality, our brain is a piece of sophisticated biological machinery that uses chemical and electrical activity. That makes us different from machines.

> Artificial intelligence resembles the brain doesn’t mean that’s how the brain works. Just like, we can never be able to fully understand someone’s thoughts, behaviours, and experiences.

## #2. Accelerate development and discoveries

Machine learning’s main strength lies in the ability to recognise patterns in complex data. Complexity is especially true when it comes to analysing our human minds. Neuroscientists are cracking the secrets of how billions of neurons work together in our brain.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging measures activity by detecting changes in the blood flow in our brain. It generates high dimensional snapshots of brain activity every second. Using machine learning to analyse data is speeding up the research, as it helps researchers to uncover the patterns in brain activities.

Machine learning also helps us develop applications that were never possible before. [Korean University](https://towardsdatascience.com/decoding-brain-signals-with-machine-learning-and-neuroscience-bee288c1d585?source=friends_link&sk=ef44e89d2c47306292a46b486b858196) designed an experimental environment for controlling a lower-limb exoskeleton. Users can control the exoskeleton by focuses their attention by staring at blinking lights.

# Neuroscience and artificial intelligence

Naturally, these [two disciplines would fit together](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-in-brain-computer-interface-f650d00268d0?source=friends_link&sk=d34b6f7371922cc55304fb70e33b7a45) and continue to [build on each other’s insights](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/ai-and-neuroscience-virtuous-circle).

Whereby, the human brain is the paramount inspiration for building human-like artificial intelligence, AI researchers can use ideas from neuroscience to build new algorithms.

And, artificial intelligence provides the means for further research in neuroscience, neuroscientists can learn from the behaviour of artificial agents to interpret our brains.

I’m optimistic about the future of this partnership between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

> We urge researchers in neuroscience and AI to find a common language, allowing a free flow of knowledge that will allow continued progress on both fronts. — [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/ai-and-neuroscience-virtuous-circle)
