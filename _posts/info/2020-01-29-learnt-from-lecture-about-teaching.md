This story has nothing to do with the actual content that is covered in class. But instead, it is focusing on the teaching style and delivery methods.

This story is a note for myself and for anyone who teaches; on what I have experienced today, and on things that I should be aware of in future when it is my turn to teach.

# Unintelligible slides

The slides are flooded with mathematical equations. I know it is a post-grad level course, but if the purpose of teaching is for students to learn, then it should be spoken in the universal language, English.

We learnt to use our languages at a young age, whereas we learnt about mathematical equations (especially graduate-level ones) much later. Slides after slides of explanations mathematical equations form? The explanations can be done with an illustration or even simply a sequence of text description explaining how each step works.

# Constantly talking

My lecturer assumes we know everything that was taught in class. I am not sure about the other students; for some parts, I was lost, for some parts, I regarded it as not necessary.

If I were to teach, I need to prepare content that is relevant to my class. My students may not understand why they need to know this topic; I need to tell them and show them, why this is good for them to know. Other than for the purpose to pass the exam.

# Ask for the sake of asking

My lecturer asked the class "any questions?" And answered right away, "no, good."

And I see students in front of me, giving the "what?" hand gestures.

As a lecturer, do we have to care whether the students understand the content? Or are we just doing a job and pass the time?

As an inspiring researcher now, my turn to teach will come, and I want my class to understand. The environment has to be one that is safe for questions. I don't have to rush through it. I can ask for a show of hands to check their understanding.
