# Project Euler

Inspired by [freecodecamp post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) from [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia), the idea is to go through the first 100 problems from the [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/).

The list of problems can be found on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/).

## About the Project Euler Problems
[Project Euler]((https://projecteuler.net/)) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems meant to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational manner.
