                  <p class="mdc-typography--body1">This year, I've been traveling to Hangzhou throughout the year, working with <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/">Alibaba</a> counterparts. My main focus this year is to work on recommendations systems for campaigns (such as double 11) and vouchers recommendation.</p>
                  <p class="mdc-typography--subtitle2">My involvement in campaigns</p>
                  <p class="mdc-typography--body1">As my modules are shown at the top and throughout the main campaign page, the purpose is to improve click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate. My modules recommends a list of categories and shops which are personalised for every users. I've built 2 types of models for CTR, parameter server logistic regression and Wide and Deep model, and challenges to improve CTR from previous campaigns.</p>
                  <p class="mdc-typography--subtitle2">Recommends the best vouchers to the right person</p>
                  <p class="mdc-typography--body1">For vouchers, my models and modules recommends voucher for every user to improve redemption rate which converts to sales. I also built voucher redemption model to predict every customer spending habits, type of vouchers users collect and redeem, and did A/B testing to validation every model performance.</p>
