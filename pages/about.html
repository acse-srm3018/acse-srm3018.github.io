              <p>I've been travelling to Hangzhou throughout the year, working with <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/">Alibaba</a> counterparts. My main focus this year is to work on recommendations systems for campaigns (such as double 11) and vouchers recommendation.</p>
              <h1>My involvement in campaigns</h1>
              <p>As my modules are shown at the top and throughout the main campaign page, the purpose is to improve the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate. My modules recommend a list of categories and shops which are personalised for every user. I've built 2 types of models for CTR, parameter server logistic regression and Wide and Deep model, and challenges to improve CTR from previous campaigns.</p>
              <h1>Recommends the best vouchers to the right person</h1>
              <p>For vouchers, my modules recommend voucher for users to improve the redemption rate which converts to sales. I also built the voucher redemption model to predict customers spending habits, type of vouchers users collect and redeem, and did A/B testing to validation every model performance.</p>

              <h1>Built a text analytic web app</h1>
              <p>As there are many ad-hoc requests to analyse text data from surveys or documents, I built a user-friendly text analytic web-based app for corporate staffs. I further improve it by understanding the pain points users faced at their work, and by getting their feedback from using the tool. Users upload their data and the backend server will extract topics and topic/entity-level sentiments. Users can explore their data from the interactive dashboard and further analyse the data by slicing the data by demographics and search functions. This reduced time that is taken to analyse and report by eliminating the time spent on reading lengthy documents. The user interface is built on Angular, and backend is Python with Flask, TensorFlow, Spacy and various packages.</p>
              <h1>Predict possible machine failures</h1>
              <p>I'm also involved in 1) analysis of sensor data of engines from naval ships, 2) accident logs from vehicles, and 3) failure logs from aircraft. The findings from my analysis match the domain knowledge of subject matter experts, thus gaining trust and confidence from users that data science is applicable for them. I am also part of the team that designed and developed prototypes for showcasing fleet management systems, which has gained many approval and funding, from both internal staffs and external ministers.</p>

                  <p>Our team got the 2nd place (out of 30 teams) to explore the obstacles map and finding the shortest path from assigned point A to point B. This robotics project has 3 main parts, logic (on a raspberry pi), hardware (on Arduino), and control & display (on android). There are many challenges, from the hardware such as power supply affecting calibrated motors, irregular readings from sensors, to the limitation on processing power on the raspberry pi.

My best record for static breath hold is 4 mins and 50 seconds, and longest single breath swim across the pool is 90 metres. I have only managed to dive in a few places around the warm waters in south-east Asia.</p>
              <p>I also enjoy travelling, especially if it is a road trip with scenery and good food. My favourite road trip experience is in Hokkaido. Road trip from Gold Coast to Great Ocean Road and horse riding at Alpine National Park was very memorable too. I hope to do a US/Canada road trip one day.</p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freediving">Freediving</a>! I enjoy being in the water, especially if there are fishes. My best record for static breath hold is 4 mins and 50 seconds, and longest single breath swim across the pool is 90 metres. I have only managed to dive in a few places around the warm waters in south-east Asia.</p>

          <p>I also enjoy travelling, especially if it is a road trip with scenery and good food. My favourite road trip experience is in Hokkaido. Road trip from Gold Coast to Great Ocean Road and horse riding at Alpine National Park was very memorable too. I hope to do a US/Canada road trip one day.</p>
