        <li>ImageNet and medical data are different: classification objective, dataset size, number of labels</li>
        <li>transfer learning from ImageNet models, do not affect significant performance, despite increase parameters</li>
        <li>feature reuse at the lowest layers could be useful, as larger model has smaller hidden representation changes, also improve convergence speed</li>
